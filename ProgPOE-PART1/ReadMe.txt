ST10440287 ProgPOE-PART1

To use my project you'll open up visual studios and open up the ProgPOE-PART1 project. This project is a Cybersecurity Awareness Bot that will give you information and tips on how to stay safe online. It'll give you advice about password safety, Phishing scams and safe browsing habits. When you run the program, you'll be greeted by a voice and an ASCII logo to welcome you into the program. You'll need to enter your name first in order to ask the bot some questions. If you do not type in your name, you'll be prompted to enter your name or otherwise you will not be able to go further in the program and see the abilities the bot can do. This project exists to help South African citizens learn how to stay safe online by avoiding common cybersecurity threats. There is a huge lack of safety online these days and programs and projects like this will help people avoid getting scammed or accidentally giving away personal information about themselves.
